# Brownian-Motion

Brownian.py contains 2 functions: `BrownianPath` and `BrownianSim` that generates and displays a 2D random walk for *nsteps* which is the
number of increments. 

The last two lines of the file gives implementation details:

`bPaths = BrownianPath(100)`

`BrownianSim(bPaths)`

where 100 can be replaced with any positive non zero integer.

The code was run on numpy 1.17 and matplotlib 3.1.
